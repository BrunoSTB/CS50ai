# CS50ai
Solutions to the CS50ai projects

This readme is still under development. Feel free to explore the solutions, but please note that only some parts of the entire code were actually written by me.
That is so because the CS50 course gives you a pre-developed program, for example the GUI, cell grid and mine placement in the minesweeper game, and asks you to develop some other parts, like mine marking, the logical sentences and the minesweeper AI itself.
