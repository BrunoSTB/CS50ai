# CS50ai
Solutions to the CS50ai projects

This readme is still under development. 

Feel free to explore the solutions, but please note that only some parts of the entire code were actually written by me.
**That is so because the CS50 course gives you a pre-developed program**, for example, in the minesweeper game the GUI, cell grid and initial mine placement are already implemented, your job is to **develop functionalities** like mine marking, logical sentences and the minesweeper AI itself.
